# Open Risk Manual PdfBooks

This repository hosts a Collection of **PdfBooks** extracted from the [Open Risk Manual](https://www.openriskmanual.org/wiki/Main_Page). 

The objective of PdfBooks is to select and group a self-contained subset of related Open Risk Manual resources (article entries) and make them available _offline_.

The format used for this purpose is (currently) a PDF file. The PDF file is generated automatically through the mediawiki [PDFBook extension](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:PdfBook) 

## List of PdfBooks:

* [Data Privacy Collection](./Collection/Data%20Privacy%20PdfBook%20DRAFT%2030-09-2021.pdf) (First Draft)
* [Cyber Risk Collection](./Collection/Cyber%20Risk%20PdfBook%20DRAFT%2014-10-2021.pdf) (First Draft)
* [GHG Protocol Collection](./Collection/GHG%20Protocol%20PdfBook%20DRAFT%2027-10-2021.pdf) (First Draft)


The extracts are still preliminary (including some incomplete entries / stubs). If you are interested in the PDFBook functionality and would like a particular topic organized feel free to create an issue.
